# Stable Diffusion web UI ***for UI***
A browser interface based on Gradio library for Stable Diffusion.  

***This is a fork of the original webui project:
https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki - 
with some "eye candy" added.***

It should also be noted, this is purely for fun(***dus***)

More interesting, research focused work in this realm:
 - [The original](https://github.com/costapt/vess2ret) (or, at least the first paper I read)
 - [A more recent paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20698-3) Using styleGAN and going down the track of simulating pathology. :heart_eyes: ***super cool!***

This repository already contains versions of the following custom scripts:
  - [Animator](https://github.com/Animator-Anon/Animator) - simple frame animator
  - [Deforum](https://github.com/deforum-art/deforum-for-automatic1111-webui) - for complex videos
  - [Seed Travel](https://github.com/yownas/seed_travel) - Create a series of images with shifting seeds
  - [Shift Attention](https://github.com/yownas/shift-attention) - Create a series of images that shift the main focus of the image to different prompts
  - [Stable-Diffusion-webui-video](https://github.com/memes-forever/Stable-diffusion-webui-video/) - Create a video from a series of images
  - [StylePile](https://github.com/some9000/StylePile) - Create a series of images with different styles

Check the [custom scripts](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Custom-Scripts) wiki page for extra scripts developed by users.

It also contains a set of embeddings that allow you to generate ***somewhat*** realistic fundus images. 

- Embeddings allow you to add objects that the network can recognize
- Hypernetworks allow you to add the style representation of an image to an image the model generates

Model checkpoints, including the trained hypernetworks can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i8ApDJ26kMy9n1EvWYsZvztRFE_tdICd?usp=sharing)
Download and extract each folder to the working directory of this project.


To quickly test out the currently trained embeddings and hypernetworks, using the x/y plot in the text2img or img2img tab:
![](img.png)

- X Type: 'Prompt S/R'
  ```
  fundus, eye_embed_3,fundus_drusen_embed,fundus_embed_2,unifeye-embed-v0
  ```
- Y Type: 'Hypernetwork'
  ```
  none, eye_hn_3, fundus, fundus_dr_hn_do, fundus_hn_2, fundusHN,  unifeye-lin-v0,unifeye-v0
  ```
Then use a prompt like:
```
a photo of the fundus with diabetic retinopathy
```
The 'fundus' prompt is the most important, the rest are optional. - fundus is a keyword that triggers the fundus embedding to be used (and that embedding will get replaced with the other options seperated by ',' in the prompt S/R field)

The 'none' hypernetwork is the default, and will be used if you don't specify a hypernetwork in the prompt. The other hypernetworks are optional, and will be used if you specify them in the prompt.

The promps above should yeild a matrix like this:
